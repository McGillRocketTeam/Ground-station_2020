# How to contribute
Push to your individual feature branch for your project then do a pull request with that project's dev branch. Please avoid pushing directly to the project's dev branch and definitely do not push to the project's master branch.

# Using JavaFX

https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#install-javafx

Important: Look at the "Running HelloWorld using JavaFX 13" part and not the gradle part because I couldn't get it to function with gradle properly.

Note: If you decide to use FXML (recommended, but do as you wish), css, or images, put them in the appropriate folder in "src/main/resources/"
