### Dev Branch
#### Installing requirements
First you make sure you have a recent version of python installed >3.7

Setup a virtual environment if you want (makes it easier to update the requirements file yourself if you use libraries which aren't currently in the requirements file)

Run the following command once in your python venv and with the terminal in the root folder of the project:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Updating requirements

To overwrite the requirements file and add new libraries use this command:

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`
